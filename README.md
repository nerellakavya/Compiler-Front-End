# Compiler-Front-End

A compiler which converts source code to Intermediate Representation for Decaf Programming Language.

## Scanner

Lexical Analyzer/Scanner is not handwritten but generated by flex. The automatic scanner generator takes as input language's micro-syntax as represented in exp.lex file.

## Parser

Bison is used to automatically generate Parser. Bison converts an annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR (1) parser tables. The CFG is represented in exp.yacc file.

## Abstract Syntax Tree generation

The Parser generated by the parser is then converted to Abstract Syntax Tree by the exp.cpp code.

## Implementation Details

- Source Files
  - exp.lex
  - exp.yacc
  - exp.h
  - exp.cpp
  - makefile
  
- Input Files
  - input.txt : The code in decaf programming Language used as input to test the compiler front end implementation.
 
- Output Files
  - output.xml : Contains the AST generated.
  - flex_output.txt : Contains the generated scanner.
  - bison_output.txt : Contains the generated parser.
  
## To Run

```bash script.sh```
  
## Semantic Checking

Simple semantic check like the following are done.

- Using a variable without declaration
- Performing incompatible operations like int + char or int + boolean etc.
